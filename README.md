</p>

* **Conciliation**: This feature allows you to import .txt files containing lesson data provided by third parties (such as schools or educational platforms). The software then performs a reconciliation process, ensuring that the imported lessons match your recorded lessons in terms of execution date, price, duration, student, and lesson type. This helps maintain data consistency and accuracy between your records and those of external partners.
